Implementation for CVPR 2015 Paper: "An Improved Deep Learning Architecture for Person Re-Identification".

[`Paper link`](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Ahmed_An_Improved_Deep_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)

This architechture is implemented based on `Keras` with `Tensorflow` backen using `Python` Programming Language.

## Train the model on which dataset?
